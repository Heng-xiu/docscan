# Control if text has to be extracted and how the text

# values include:
#  multiplexer   Chooses more specific analyzer based
#                on filename extension; handles compressed
#                files transparently (xz, gz, bz2, lzma)
# The multiplexer uncompresses found files transparently
# and delegates the actual analysis to one of the following
# specific analyzers which can be chosen directly here as well:
#  odf           Apply OpenDocument Format analysis on
#                every file found matching the filter
#  openxml       Apply OfficeOpenXML analysis on every
#                file found matching the filter
#  pdf           Apply PDF analysis on every file found
#                matching the filter
#  compoundbinary  Apply analysis for legacy Microsoft
#                Office formats on every file found
#                matiching the filter
#  zip           Scan .zip files' content; found files will be
#                delegated to the multiplexer
#  jpeg          Analyze JPEG photo/image files
#  jp2           Analyze JPEG2000 photo/image files
# Note 1: Only 'multiplexer' can handle compressed files
# Note 2: It is a safe choice to pick 'multiplexer' here
#         and specify a filter above.
