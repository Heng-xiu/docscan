# This script does the following:
# 1. Read a tab-separated .csv file from stdin and optionally take a 'number of
#    header lines' as command line argument (if omitted, 2 is the default).
# 2. For all lines following the header lines, separate columns by tab character
#    and sort rows numerically by last column's value.
# 3. Dump sorted rows.

# two header lines by default, unless a single argument is passed with a different value

# read from stdin, redirect to temporary file
while read line ; do echo "${line}" ; done >${tempfile}
