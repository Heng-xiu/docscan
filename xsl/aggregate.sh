# This script does the following:
# 1. Takes a varying number of tab-separated .csv files as command line arguments.
# 2. Prints the first file's first line
# 3. For all files, takes all lines starting from the second one and for each column
#    starting from the second column, take the numeric value, add it in an array
#    (column number is index); the index is stored in a hash where the first column's
#    value is the key.
#    In case the current value is not numeric, just write it as-is into the hash-array
#    data structure.
# 4. As the hash is kept for all files and each first column value is unique within
#    each file, the hash-array data structure aggregates all unique key-column values
#    across all .csv files.
# 5. Finally, print a new tab-separated table that looks like the input tables. This
#    table contains the aggregated values. In case there is a 'total' key (row) in
#    the input files, this row will be printed first.
