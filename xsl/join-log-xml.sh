# This script does the following:
# 1. Takes a varying number of .xml or .xml.xz files as command line arguments.
# 2. In case of .xml.xz files, those will be decompressed to .xml files.
# 3. For each processed .xml file:
#    a. Remove XML header and enclosing <log>...</log> tags
#    b. Remove invalid characters (ASCII codes 1 to 31)
#    c. Remove very log error messages
# 4. Dump all 'inner' XML data, but wrap it into a valid XML output, i.e.
#    re-inserting <?xml ...><log>...</log>
